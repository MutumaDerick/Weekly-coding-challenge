# Weekly Code Challenge - Python Basics
This repository contains Python scripts that address five different tasks related to basic concepts in Python. The tasks involve working with lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, aiming to strengthen your understanding of these fundamental data structures.

# Challenge Overview
This weekly code challenge consists of five tasks that test your ability to manipulate lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets in Python. Below are the tasks along with brief descriptions:

# Task 1: Sum of Integers in a List
Description: Write a program that accepts user input to create a list of integers. Then, compute and display the sum of all the integers in the list.
# Task 2: Favorite Books Tuple
Description: Create a tuple containing the names of five of your favorite books. Then, use a for loop to print each book name on a separate line.
# Task 3: Personal Information Dictionary
Description: Write a program that uses a dictionary to store information about a person, such as their name, age, and favorite color. Ask the user for input and store the information in the dictionary. Then, print the dictionary to the console.
# Task 4: Common Elements in Two Sets
Description: Write a program that accepts user input to create two sets of integers. Then, create a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets and print the result.
# Task 5: Words with Odd Number of Characters
Description: Create a program that stores a list of words. Then, use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the words that have an odd number of characters.
